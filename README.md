GEOPOINT
Updates that allow the index mappings to correctly map a geopoint for kibana and grafana maps.

elastic-geopoint-full.json contains the geopoint information along with the full mappings for other data.
elastic-geopoint.json is just the geopoint mapping.
index-map-import.sh is a sample curl command to import the mapping.
